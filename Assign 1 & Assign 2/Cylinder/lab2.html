      <p>
        I did not submit Assignment 1 because I wasn't sure if I was going to continue with the class but I am. Therefore, I would like to attempt ALL the required points for Assignment 1. 

        <br><br>
        I have attempted all the required points except exporting
        the SOR doesn't quite work. I will get it done by the next assignment.
