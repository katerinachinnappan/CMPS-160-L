        Lab 6<br>
        Scale/Translate/Rotate
      </h3>
      <p>
        Attempting for all the required points. Also, I would like to note that for Lab 5 I did attempt for point # 3R. (The objects on the canvas are displayed with a perspective projection). Its defined in the proj-mtrx.js which is found in the lib folder. Draws cylinder with polylines. Can highlight and un-highlight the cylinder. Can scale with the wheel (on mac its like zoom in and zoom out). Can rotate when right clicking. Can translate by pressing and dragging across the canvas. Prints pixel color out to the console.
